                Tricks and Lessons Learned---------</h1>
            <div class=content id=content>
                <p>Building a custom PC from scratch can be a daunting task, especially if you are not familiar
                    with the process. However, with the right tools, guidance, and patience, it can be a
                    rewarding experience. In this blog, I will share my personal journey of building a custom
                    PC, along with some tips, tricks, and lessons learned.</p>
                <p>First, I had to decide on the parts I wanted for my PC. I did some research online and
                    consulted with friends who had built their own computers. Eventually, I settled on the
                    following specifications:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Processor: AMD Ryzen 5 5600X</li>
                    <li>Motherboard: MSI MAG B550 Torpedo</li>
                    <li>Graphics Card: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070ti(tentative)</li>
                    <li>Memory: G.SKILL Trident Z Neo 32GB (2*16GB) DDR4 3600MHz</li>
                    <li>Storage: XPG ADATA GAMMIX S50 Lite 1TB M.2 and Ant Esports 690 Neo Sata 2.5" 1 TB</li>
                    <li>Power Supply: GIGABYTE P750GM 750W 80 Plus Modular Power Supply</li>
                    <li>CPU cooler: Cooler Master Hyper H410R RGB CPU Cooler</li>
                    <li>cabinet: Ant Esports ICE-511MT</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Once I had all the parts, I laid them out on a table and started assembling the PC. I
                    followed a step-by-step guide, which was included with the motherboard, to install the CPU,
                    memory, and storage. Then, I installed the graphics card and power supply.
                    The cabinet is where all the components of your PC will be housed, so it is essential to
                    ensure that everything is installed correctly.</p>
                <p>Start by installing the power supply unit (PSU) at the bottom of the cabinet. Most cabinets
                    will have a separate compartment for the PSU to ensure proper ventilation and cooling.
                    Install the RAM into the appropriate slots. Next, install the storage drives, such as hard
                    drives or solid-state drives, into the appropriate bays. Next, install the motherboard onto
                    the standoffs in the cabinet. Make sure that the I/O shield is properly installed before
                    mounting the motherboard.</p>
                <p>Connect all the necessary cables, such as power cables for the motherboard, CPU, and graphics
                    card, SATA cables for storage devices, and front panel connectors for the case.</p>
                <p>Finally, I connected all the cables and turned on the PC.</p>
                <p>After turning on the PC, I encountered a few issues, such as the system not recognizing the
                    RAM and the graphics card not working properly. However, I was able to troubleshoot these
                    issues by consulting online forums and guides, and eventually got my custom PC up and
                    running.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, building a custom PC can be a rewarding experience if you have the patience
                    and dedication to see it through. My journey of building a custom PC taught me the
                    importance of research, planning, and troubleshooting. If you are thinking of building your
                    own PC, make sure to do your research, consult with experts, and be patient.</p>
